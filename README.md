# Implementation of Simulation of Operating System

Implemented featurs:
* Booting,
* Process and threads management (PCB and TCB records),
* Memory management,
* Storage managenet (VFS + FAT32) with basic file operations (based on file handlers),
* Kernel ans User space (with syscalls mechanism),
* Shell with fundamental commands (cd, dir, echo, freq, md, ps, rd, rgen, rtl, shutdown, sort, type, wc)
* Pipes (with cyclic buffer) and redirection techniques,
* Binary semaphore for synchronization (such as disabling interuption)
